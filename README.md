# Investigate a Dataset - TMDB Movie Dataset
This repository contains a project focused on investigating the TMDB Movie Dataset. The main functions of this project include data wrangling, exploratory data analysis (EDA), and drawing conclusions based on the findings.

## Introduction
The TMDB Movie Dataset is a comprehensive collection of movie-related information such as titles, release dates, budgets, revenues, genres, and ratings. The goal of this project is to explore and analyze the dataset to gain insights into various aspects of the movie industry.

## Data Wrangling
The data wrangling phase involves gathering, assessing, and cleaning the dataset to ensure its quality and suitability for analysis. This includes handling missing values, removing duplicates, correcting data types, and performing any necessary transformations.

## Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
During the exploratory data analysis phase, we delve into the dataset to uncover patterns, relationships, and trends. This involves generating summary statistics, visualizations, and conducting statistical analyses to answer specific research questions. The EDA phase aims to provide a deeper understanding of the dataset and reveal interesting insights.

## Conclusions
Based on the findings from the data analysis, conclusions are drawn to summarize the key insights and address the research questions or objectives of the project. This section presents a concise summary of the observations, trends, and patterns discovered throughout the investigation.
